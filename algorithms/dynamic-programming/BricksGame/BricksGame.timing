	20:21 - started
	20:43 - done paper
	21:01 - bad examp
	21:21 - FAILED
	21:34 - done it with recursion. It seems my dp failed because I forgot that stack top is at index 0 in this challenge.
	21:43 - done DP proper.
	21:52 - editorial: you don't need index of opponent move because sumFirst + sumSecond == sumArray!
