PROBLEM: candies (.c)
	21:03 - started
	21:18 - paper solution
	21:31 - done code
	21:32 - segfailt on most of tests!? lol, I used 10000 instead of 100000 for array size
			now I know why tourist uses 12345
			also my algo is bad
	22:06 - ofc algo was again simpler than I thought, space dimension was O(1) not O(N)
	22:12 - 2 out of 10!?
	22:32 - argh, it took me 20 min to find stupid edgecase.
