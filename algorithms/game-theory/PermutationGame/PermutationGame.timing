## PermutationGame
FIRST: (.java)
	20:31 - started
	21:03 - half-done paper 
	21:16 - 1/10 for brute force :)
	21:21 - 2/10 after one refinement
	21:56 - done. Solved with stupid recursion + memoization technique
	22:03 - after reading comments I see correct thinking was DP because n=15 fits into an integer bitmask.
			all in all I prefer my String HashMap solution over DP and bitmagic
			in fact my solution will work better for bigger inputs than DP bitmask because intermediate results are shared between tests.
