My solutions for hackerrank problems, duh.
 
WARNING: It should be obvious to you that looking at other peoples solutions before you try to solve a problem yourself is bad for you.
My advice is to make your own [UNSOLVED.txt](https://github.com/cohadar/hackerrank/blob/master/UNSOLVED.txt) and revisit problems after couple of weeks.
Do not cheat yourself.
